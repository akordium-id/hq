## Executive Summary

The Indonesian wedding planning market is highly fragmented with no dominant all-in-one player. Competitors focus on single features (guestbook, invitations, budgeting), while Sesarra combines planning + vendor management + cloud storage + memory preservation in one platform.

**Key Finding:** No direct competitor offers end-to-end wedding planning with unlimited cloud storage "forever" - this is Sesarra's unique competitive advantage.
