## Executive Summary

This document outlines Sesarra's pricing strategy validation approach. The goal is to determine optimal price points that maximize conversion while capturing sufficient value to build a sustainable business.

**Hypothesis:** Premium positioning (Rp 199k-499k) aligns with target market's willingness to pay for "forever memory preservation" emotional value.

## Pricing Objectives

### Business Objectives

1. **Maximize Revenue:** Achieve Rp 25-35 Million ARR in Year 1
2. **Drive Premium Adoption:** Convert 30%+ of users to Premium tier (Rp 499k)
3. **Build Sustainable Unit Economics:** LTV:CAC ratio > 3:1
4. **Competitive Positioning:** Premium vs. Guestron (Rp 99k), affordable vs. wedding planners (Rp 10-50M)

### Customer Objectives

1. **Perceived Value:** Price must feel "worth it" for comprehensive solution
2. **Risk Reduction:** Free trial or money-back guarantee reduces purchase friction
3. **Flexibility:** Offer both one-time and annual options
4. **Emotional Connection:** "Forever memories" justifies premium pricing

## Pricing Tier Strategy

### Proposed Pricing Structure

| Tier | Price | Storage | Features | Target |
|------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Basic** | Free | 50 photos | Checklist templates, basic budget, 100 guests | Try before buy |
| **Standard** | Rp 199,000 (one-time) | 1,000 photos (10GB) | All features except vendor booking, 1-year storage | Budget-conscious couples |
| **Premium** | Rp 499,000 (annual) | Unlimited (forever) | All features + vendor booking + memory timeline | Primary target (affluent couples) |
| **Vendor** | Rp 999,000 (annual) | N/A | B2B marketplace access, analytics dashboard | Wedding vendors |

### Price Point Rationale

**Rp 199,000 (Standard - One-Time):**
- **Psychological Pricing:** Below Rp 200k "mental barrier"
- **Competitive Positioning:** 2x Guestron (Rp 99k) but 10x more features
- **Wedding Budget %:** 0.04% of Rp 500M wedding (negligible)
- **Anchor Effect:** Makes Premium (Rp 499k) seem like better value

**Rp 499,000 (Premium - Annual):**
- **Forever Value Proposition:** "Pay once, memories preserved forever"
- **Competitive Positioning:** 1,000x cheaper than wedding planner (Rp 10-50M)
- **Wedding Budget %:** 0.1% of Rp 500M wedding (still negligible)
- **Revenue Maximization:** Primary revenue driver (target 70% of paying users)

**Rp 999,000 (Vendor - Annual):**
- **B2B Pricing Logic:** Vendors earn Rp 5-20M per wedding, 10% commission = Rp 500k-2M
- **Sesarra Fee:** Rp 999k/year = <Rp 85k/month (business expense, not personal)
- **ROI for Vendors:** 1 booking commission covers entire year's subscription

## Price Sensitivity Testing Plan

### A/B Test Design

**Test 1: One-Time vs. Annual Preference**

**Variant A:** Rp 199,000 (one-time, 1-year access)
- 1,000 photos storage
- All Standard features
- Auto-renewal reminder after 1 year

**Variant B:** Rp 499,000 (annual, forever storage)
- Unlimited photos storage
- All Premium features
- Auto-renewal annually (cancel anytime)

**Hypothesis:** Couples prefer one-time payment for wedding (one-time event), but "forever storage" value prop drives Premium adoption.

**Success Metric:** Premium conversion > 30% of paying users

---

**Test 2: Price Point Testing (Standard Tier)**

**Variant A:** Rp 149,000 (loss leader)
**Variant B:** Rp 199,000 (current hypothesis)
**Variant C:** Rp 249,000 (premium positioning)

**Hypothesis:** Rp 199k is optimal balance of conversion + revenue.

**Success Metric:** Rp 199k variant generates highest total revenue (conversion × price).

---

**Test 3: "Forever Storage" Perceived Value**

**Variant A:** Rp 499,000/year (renew annually)
**Variant B:** Rp 999,000 one-time (true "forever", no renewal)

**Hypothesis:** Annual renewal creates anxiety, but "one-time forever" feels too risky for Sesarra (storage costs indefinite).

**Success Metric:** Annual renewal (Variant A) has higher perceived value.

### Testing Methodology

**Sample Size:**
- 100 landing page visitors per variant
- Total: 300-500 visitors across all variants
- Duration: 4-6 weeks

**Traffic Sources:**
- Instagram ads (wedding hashtags)
- Google ads (SEO: "wedding planner Indonesia")
- Organic (blog content, social media)

**Measurement:**
- Conversion rate (free → paid)
- Tier split (Standard vs. Premium)
- Churn rate (cancellations)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)

## Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) Research

### Customer Interview Questions

**Direct Questions:**

1. "Berapa maximum Anda mau bayar untuk aplikasi all-in-one wedding planning + unlimited cloud storage?"

   *Response Categories:*
   - < Rp 100k (too cheap, not viable)
   - Rp 100-200k (Standard tier sweet spot)
   - Rp 200-500k (Premium tier sweet spot)
   - Rp 500k-1M (luxury segment)
   - > Rp 1M (unlikely)

2. "Lebih pilih one-time payment atau annual subscription? Kenapa?"

   *Listen for:*
   - One-time: "Wedding is one-time event, why pay recurring?"
   - Annual: "Peace of mind, auto-renewal is easier"

3. "Apakah 'forever storage' value prop cukup strong untuk justify Rp 499k/tahun?"

   *Listen for:*
   - Emotional resonance: "My grandchildren will see these photos"
   - Skepticism: "Will Sesarra exist in 10 years?"
   - Alternative: "Google Photos is free"

**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter:**

Ask 4 questions (scale from Rp 0 to Rp 1M):

1. "At what price would you consider Sesarra **too expensive** to consider buying?"
2. "At what price would you consider Sesarra **expensive but still worth considering**?"
3. "At what price would you consider Sesarra **a great bargain**?"
4. "At what price would you consider Sesarra **too cheap to trust quality**?"

**Analysis:**
- **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** Intersection of "not too expensive" and "not too cheap"
- **Indifference Price Point (IPP):** Price where equal numbers say "expensive" vs. "cheap"
- **Expected WTP:** 60-80% of target market willing to pay ≥ Rp 199k

## Revenue Model Analysis

### Unit Economics (Year 1 Projections)

**Assumptions:**
- 100 paying customers (Year 1 target)
- Tier split: 20% Standard (Rp 199k), 80% Premium (Rp 499k)
- Annual churn: 20% (wedding is one-time, but anniversaries drive retention)

**Calculations:**

**Revenue:**
- Standard: 20 customers × Rp 199k = Rp 3.98 Million
- Premium: 80 customers × Rp 499k = Rp 39.92 Million
- **Total ARR:** Rp 43.9 Million

**Costs:**
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): Rp 150k/customer
- Total CAC: 100 customers × Rp 150k = Rp 15 Million
- Variable Costs (storage, payment processing): Rp 50k/customer/year
- Total Variable Costs: 100 customers × Rp 50k = Rp 5 Million
- Fixed Costs (server, team, marketing): Rp 25 Million/year

**Profitability:**
- Gross Revenue: Rp 43.9 Million
- Variable Costs: Rp 5 Million
- Gross Margin: Rp 38.9 Million (89%)
- Fixed Costs: Rp 25 Million
- Net Profit: Rp 13.9 Million (32% margin)

**LTV (Lifetime Value):**
- Average ARPU: (20% × Rp 199k + 80% × Rp 499k) = Rp 439k
- Average Customer Lifetime: 3 years (anniversary reminders drive retention)
- **LTV:** Rp 439k × 3 = Rp 1.317 Million

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- LTV: Rp 1.317 Million
- CAC: Rp 150k
- **Ratio:** 8.8:1 (excellent, healthy unit economics)

### Break-Even Analysis

**Monthly Break-Even:**
- Fixed Costs: Rp 25M/year ÷ 12 = Rp 2.083M/month
- Contribution Margin per Customer: Rp 439k (ARPU) - Rp 50k (variable) = Rp 389k
- Break-Even Customers: Rp 2.083M ÷ Rp 389k = **5.36 customers/month**

**Annual Break-Even:**
- Fixed Costs: Rp 25M/year
- Break-Even Customers: Rp 25M ÷ Rp 389k = **64 customers/year**

**Conclusion:** Very achievable. 64 customers/year = 5 customers/month (realistic with organic + paid growth).

## Pricing Psychology Principles

### Anchoring Effect

**Strategy:** Display Premium tier (Rp 499k) first to anchor high price, then show Standard (Rp 199k) as "bargain".

**Implementation:**
```
PREMIUM - Rp 499,000/tahun (Most Popular!)
✅ Unlimited cloud storage forever
✅ Vendor booking integration
✅ Memory timeline & anniversary reminders

STANDARD - Rp 199,000 one-time
✅ 1,000 photos (10GB storage)
✅ All planning tools
✅ 1-year storage included

BASIC - Free
✅ 50 photos
❌ Basic planning tools
```

### Charm Pricing

**Strategy:** End prices in "9" (Rp 199k, Rp 499k) instead of round numbers (Rp 200k, Rp 500k).

**Psychological Impact:**
- Rp 199k feels like "100-something thousand" not "200 thousand"
- Rp 499k feels like "400-something thousand" not "500 thousand"

### Payment Framing

**Option A:** "Rp 499,000 per tahun"
**Option B:** "Rp 41,583 per bulan" (Rp 499k ÷ 12)

**Strategy:** Use both frames in marketing copy:
- "Only Rp 41k/month for forever wedding memories"
- "Less than Rp 1,400 per day"

**Impact:** Makes Rp 499k feel more affordable (daily coffee money).

## Pricing Strategy Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Price Resistance

**Concern:** Target market may perceive Rp 199-499k as "expensive app" (vs. free alternatives like Excel, WhatsApp).

**Mitigation:**
1. **Value Communication:** Emphasize 10x features vs. competitors
2. **Free Trial:** 14-day free trial to reduce risk
3. **Money-Back Guarantee:** 7-day refund policy
4. **Social Proof:** Testimonials from early adopters

### Risk 2: Storage Costs Unsustainable

**Concern:** "Unlimited forever" storage becomes unprofitable if users upload 10,000+ photos/videos.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Fair Use Policy:** "Unlimited" = 1TB per couple (covers 99% of use cases)
2. **File Size Limits:** Max 50MB per photo, 5GB per video
3. **Compression:** Auto-compress photos (WebP format) without quality loss
4. **Tiered Pricing:** If >1TB, upsell to "Enterprise Tier" (Rp 999k/year)

### Risk 3: Competitors Undercut Pricing

**Concern:** Guestron or Bridestory launches "all-in-one" product at lower price (Rp 99k).

**Mitigation:**
1. **Differentiation:** Focus on "forever memories" (emotional value) vs. planning tools (commodity)
2. **Moat:** Build vendor network (hard to replicate quickly)
3. **Switching Costs:** Once 1,000+ photos uploaded, hard to leave
4. **Brand Premium:** Position as "Apple of wedding apps" (premium worth paying for)

---

## Pricing Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Months 1-3)

**Strategy:** Test pricing with beta users (50 couples)

**Actions:**
1. Offer free access to beta users in exchange for feedback
2. Test payment flows (not actually charging yet)
3. Gather willingness-to-pay data from surveys
4. Adjust pricing based on feedback

**Success Metric:** 70%+ of beta users willing to pay ≥ Rp 199k

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Months 4-6)

**Strategy:** Launch with current pricing (Rp 199k/499k)

**Actions:**
1. A/B test price points (see "Price Sensitivity Testing" above)
2. Monitor conversion rates daily
3. Iterate on messaging if conversion < 2%
4. Introduce discounts (first 100 customers get 20% off)

**Success Metric:** 2-3% conversion (free → paid)

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 7-12)

**Strategy:** Optimize pricing based on real data

**Actions:**
1. Analyze tier split (Standard vs. Premium)
2. If Standard conversion > 60%, reduce Standard features to push Premium
3. If Premium conversion < 20%, consider reducing to Rp 399k
4. Introduce "Annual vs. One-time" pricing test

**Success Metric:** 30%+ Premium tier adoption
